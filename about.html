    <h2 style="color: #4caf50; font-size: 2.2em; margin-bottom: 20px;">About Me</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.8;">
      I am a data-driven problem solver with a strong foundation in mathematics and programming. My expertise lies in <strong>data analysis, visualization, and automation</strong>, with a particular emphasis on clarity, accuracy, and efficiency. I am proficient in <strong>Microsoft Excel</strong>, including advanced functions such as pivot tables, macros, and the creation of dynamic data dashboards that support insightful business decisions.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.8;">
      In addition to spreadsheet mastery, I write <strong>clean, modular Python code</strong> using object-oriented programming principles. I have practical experience building tools that automate tasks, process data, and support research workflows. I'm also passionate about the future of AI, and I actively explore how <strong>large language models (LLMs)</strong> can be leveraged to enhance productivity, streamline research, and power intelligent systems.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.8;">
      I am a firm believer in collaboration and transparency. I use <strong>Git and GitHub</strong> extensively to manage projects, contribute to team codebases, and maintain clean version histories. Whether working independently or as part of a team, I take pride in building scalable, reliable solutions that bridge the gap between data and decision-making.
